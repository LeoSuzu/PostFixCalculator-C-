## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- C++ compiler (e.g., g++)
- Standard C++ Library

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
  git clone https://github.com/yourusername/postfix-calculator.git
  cd postfix-calculator
```

2. Compile the source code:
```bash
  g++ main.cpp Calc.cpp NumStack.cpp -o postfix-calculator
```

## Usage

### Interactive mode:
Run the following command:
```bash
./postfix-calculator -p
```
Enter numbers separated by spaces and specify the operation at the end. For example:
```bash
2 3 +
````
Output: 5

## Command-Line Mode
Addition:
```bash
./postfix-calculator "2 3 +"
```
Output: 5


Subtraction:
```bash
./postfix-calculator "2 3 -"
```
Output: -1


Multiplication:
```bash
./postfix-calculator "4 7 *"
```
Output: 28


Division:
```bash
./postfix-calculator "9 3 /"
```
Output: 3


Exponentiation:
```bash
./postfix-calculator "2 3 e"
```
Output: 8

Summation:
```bash
./postfix-calculator "2 2 2 2 2 s"
```
Output: 10

Square root:
```bash
./postfix-calculator "9 r"
```
Output: 3

Average:
```bash
./postfix-calculator "2 4 8 a"
```

Modulo:
```bash
./postfix-calculator "9 3 %"
```
Output: 0

Swap top two elements:
```bash
./postfix-calculator "2 3 x -"
```
Output: 1
